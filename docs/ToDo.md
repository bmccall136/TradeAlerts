1. Layer in Position Sizing & Risk Controls
Fixed % Risk per Trade: Decide you’ll never risk more than 1–2% of your total capital on any alert.

Stop‑Loss Rules: Automatically attach a stop (e.g. 2–3% below entry, or under the lower Bollinger band) when an alert fires.

Trailing Stops: Once in profit by X%, move your stop up to lock in gains.

Why it helps: you protect gains and cap losses, boosting net performance even if raw signals aren’t perfect.

2. Add a Backtest & Analytics Dashboard
Simulate every alert over, say, the last 1–2 years on historical data.

Track:

Win rate (% of trades that hit your profit target before stop)

Average P/L per trade

Max drawdown

Sharpe ratio

Iterate: adjust your trigger thresholds (e.g. require MACD + RSI + Bollinger and volume spike) based on performance.

Why it helps: data‑driven tuning finds the sweet spot between too few and too many alerts.

3. Enrich Your Feature Set
Volume Spikes: only fire if volume > X day average.

Multi‑Timeframe Confirmation: require your MACD or RSI setup on both daily and 4‑hr charts.

Correlation Filter: avoid symbols moving purely on sector bets by checking whether they’re diverging from their index.

Why it helps: adds context, reduces “false positive” noise.

4. Introduce Machine‑Learning Scoring (Optional)
Gather your technical indicator values + sentiment score + recent returns

Train a simple logistic model or random forest to predict next‑day up/down probability

Only alert when your model’s probability > some threshold (e.g. 65%)

Why it helps: blends signals in a nonlinear way and can adapt as market regimes shift.

5. Automate Performance Reporting
Weekly email recap (via your automations) with summary stats and top/bottom performers

Keeps you honest and highlights what’s working or needs tweaking

Next Steps: pick one of the above—say, backtesting your current “3‑trigger + sentiment” logic—and build that analytic layer first. Then iterate from actual performance, not gut feel. Over time your scanner will feel less “garbage” and more like a precision instrument.
