### Best Practices

- **Trade only top signals**: Quality over quantity = real growth.
- **Stick to risk management**: 1% risk/trade, cut losers, let winners run.
- **Use S&P/NASDAQ for most of your capital**; add “top movers” or “news play” lists for alpha.
- **Backtest every tweak before going live**: The system makes this easy!
- **Journal and review**: Use export logs and simulation stats to improve every month.
